                     <mif:p>The HL7 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) is a document markup standard that specifies the structure and semantics of "clinical documents" for the purpose of exchange. A clinical document is a documentation of clinical observations and services, with the following characteristics: </mif:p>
                     <mif:ol>
                        <mif:li>
                           <mif:b>Persistence:</mif:b> A clinical document continues to exist in an unaltered state, for a time period defined by local and regulatory requirements (NOTE: There is a distinct scope of persistence for a clinical document, independent of the persistence of any XML-encoded CDA document instance). </mif:li>
                        <mif:li>
                           <mif:b>Stewardship:</mif:b> A clinical document is maintained by an organization entrusted with its care. </mif:li>
                        <mif:li>
                           <mif:b>Potential for authentication:</mif:b> A clinical document is an assemblage of information that is intended to be legally authenticated.</mif:li>
                        <mif:li>
                           <mif:b>Context:</mif:b> A clinical document establishes the default context for its contents. </mif:li>
                        <mif:li>
                           <mif:b>Wholeness:</mif:b> Authentication of a clinical document applies to the whole and does not apply to portions of the document without the full context of the document. </mif:li>
                        <mif:li>
                           <mif:b>Human readability:</mif:b> A clinical document is human readable.</mif:li>
                     </mif:ol>
                     <mif:p>A CDA document is a defined and complete information object that can include text, images, sounds, and other multimedia content.</mif:p>

                     <mif:p>Key aspects of the CDA include: </mif:p>
                     <mif:ul>
                        <mif:li>CDA documents are encoded in Extensible Markup Language (XML). (NOTE: When alternate implementations are feasible, suitable conformance requirements will be issued so that in future the syntax may not be limited to XML.) </mif:li>
                        <mif:li>CDA documents derive their machine processable meaning from the HL7 Reference Information Model (RIM) and use the HL7 Version 3 Data Types. </mif:li>
                        <mif:li>The CDA specification is richly expressive and flexible. Document-level, section-level and entry-level templates can be used to constrain the generic CDA specification (see The "A" in "CDA" ). </mif:li>
                     </mif:ul>
                  </mif:div>
                  <mif:div hl7Id="ScopeofCDA" title="Scope of CDA">
                     <mif:p>The scope of the CDA is the standardization of clinical documents for exchange. </mif:p>
                     <mif:p>The data format of clinical documents outside of the exchange context (e.g., the data format used to store clinical documents) is not addressed in this specification. </mif:p>
                     <mif:p>CDA documents can be transmitted in HL7 messages designed to transfer clinical documents. While the detailed specification for such messages is outside of the scope of the CDA, this specification does impose requirements upon the packaging of CDA documents in HL7 messages (see CDA Document Exchange in HL7 Messages).</mif:p>
                     <mif:p>The CDA does not specify the creation or management of documents, only their exchange markup. While it may be possible to directly use the CDA Schema in a document authoring environment, such use is not the primary purpose of the CDA specification. </mif:p>
                     <mif:p>Document management is critically interdependent with the CDA specifications, but the specification of document management messages is outside the scope of the CDA. (For more on this, see Relationship of the CDA to HL7 Messaging Standards). </mif:p>
                     <mif:p>
                        <mif:b>NOTE:</mif:b> Several committees are developing structured document specifications that overlap in part with the CDA specification. The Structured Documents Technical Committee, in collaboration with Publishing and these other committees, is developing a Structured Documents Infrastructure chapter to clarify these relationships which should be available in upcoming editions. </mif:p>
                  </mif:div>
                  <mif:div hl7Id="GoalsandDesignPrinciples" title="Goals and Design Principles">
                     <mif:p>The goals of the CDA are:</mif:p>
                     <mif:ul>
                        <mif:li>Give priority to delivery of patient care.</mif:li>
                        <mif:li>Provide additional support for use cases related to secondary use of healthcare data</mif:li>
                        <mif:li>Allow cost effective implementation across as wide a spectrum of systems as possible.</mif:li>
                        <mif:li>Support exchange of human-readable documents between users, including those with different levels of technical sophistication.</mif:li>
                        <mif:li>Promote longevity of all information encoded according to this architecture.</mif:li>
                        <mif:li>Enable a wide range of post-exchange processing applications.</mif:li>
                        <mif:li>Be compatible with a wide range of document creation applications.</mif:li>
                        <mif:li>Promote exchange that is independent of the underlying transfer or storage mechanism.</mif:li>
                        <mif:li>Prepare the design reasonably quickly.</mif:li>
                        <mif:li>Enable policy-makers and implementers to control their own information requirements without extension to this specification.</mif:li>
                     </mif:ul>
                     <mif:p>A number of design principles follow from consideration of the above goals: </mif:p>
                     <mif:ul>
                        <mif:li>This architecture must be compatible with XML and the HL7 RIM.</mif:li>
                        <mif:li>This architecture must be compatible with representations of clinical information arising from other HL7 Work Groups.</mif:li>
                        <mif:li>Technical barriers to use of the architecture should be minimized.</mif:li>
                        <mif:li>The architecture specifies the representation of instances required for exchange.</mif:li>
                        <mif:li>The architecture should impose minimal constraints or requirements on document structure and content required for exchange.</mif:li>
                        <mif:li>The architecture must be scalable to accommodate fine-grained markup such as highly structured text and coded data.</mif:li>
                        <mif:li>Document specifications based on this architecture should accommodate such constraints and requirements as supplied by appropriate professional, commercial, and regulatory agencies. </mif:li>
                        <mif:li>Document specifications for document creation and processing, if intended for exchange, should map to this exchange architecture. </mif:li>
                        <mif:li>CDA documents must be human readable using widely-available and commonly-deployed XML-aware browsers and print drivers and a generic CDA style sheet written in a standard style sheet language. </mif:li>
                        <mif:li>Use open standards.</mif:li>

                        <mif:p>This section serves as a high-level introduction to the major components of a CDA document, all of which are described again and in greater detail later on. The intent here is to familiarize the reader with the high-level concepts to facilitate an understanding of the sections that follow.</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>Major components of a prototypic CDA document are shown in the following skeletal example. (Note that many required components are missing to simplify the General CDA Conceptsexample. See Samples for a detailed conformant example). </mif:p>
                        <mif:p>A CDA document is wrapped by the &lt;ClinicalDocument&gt; element, and contains a header (see Header ) and a body (see Body ). The header lies between the &lt;ClinicalDocument&gt; and the &lt;structuredBody&gt; elements, and identifies and classifies the document and provides information on authentication, the encounter, the patient, and the involved providers. </mif:p>
                        <mif:p>The body contains the clinical report, and can be either an unstructured blob, or can be comprised of structured markup. The example shows a structured body, which is wrapped by the &lt;structuredBody&gt; element, and which is divided up into recursively nestable document sections.</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>A CDA document section is wrapped by the &lt;section&gt; element. Each section can contain a single narrative block (see Section Narrative Block), and any number of CDA entries (see Entry Acts ) and external references. </mif:p>
                        <mif:p>The CDA narrative block is wrapped by the &lt;tex&gt;&gt; element within the &lt;section&gt; element, and must contain the human readable content to be rendered. See also Human Readability and Rendering CDA Documents and CDA Conformance for principles governing the representation of the narrative block, and conformance requirements on the part of originators when populating the block, and recipients when rendering it. </mif:p>
                        <mif:p>Within a document section, the narrative block represents content to be rendered, whereas CDA entries represent structured content provided for further computer processing (e.g. decision support applications). CDA entries typically encode content present in the narrative block of the same section. The example shows two &lt;observation&gt; CDA entries, and a &lt;substanceAdministration&gt; entry containing a nested &lt;supply&gt; entry, although several other CDA entries are defined. </mif:p>
                        <mif:p>CDA entries can nest and they can reference external objects. CDA external references always occur within the context of a CDA entry. External references refer to content that exists outside this CDA document - such as some other image, some other procedure, or some other observation (which is wrapped by the &lt;externalObservatio&gt; element). Externally referenced material is not covered by the authentication of the document referencing it.</mif:p>

                              <mif:p>CDA 's sections and sub-sections are organizing elements that support human readability. Although section types are coded, sections mainly organize the data in a manner appropriate for human viewing, while assuring that the rendered content is faithful to the rendering at the time the document wad legally authenticated. This is an important feature but should be seen as distinct from encoding the information for computational interoperability, decision support or analysis. Regardless of how a set of health condition and allergy information might be broken down across sections and sub-sections, it does not change the actual meaning of the information.</mif:p>
                              <mif:p>In CDA R3, it is possible to split the semantics representation (i.e., the clinical statements) and rendering representation (i.e., the sections outline). In this ballot, we only seek comments on this possible split and it's not part of the new spec.</mif:p>

                           <mif:div hl7Id="ChallengesofCoupling"
                                    title="Challenges of Coupling Semantics and Rendering">
                              <mif:p>The coupling of semantics and rendering in CDA R2 introduces a few challenges:</mif:p>
                              <mif:ul>
                                 <mif:li>The semantic information must be broken up across the different sections, resulting in the loss of the semantic relationships between data spread across sections (e.g., overall interpretation of various genetic testing results embedded in different sections). To resolve this challenge it is possible to use 'reference' links scattered throughout the semantic portion of the model but it overloads the traversal needed for parsing application to re-constitute the full semantic picture.</mif:li>
                                 <mif:li>The need to break information down into sections is a significant barrier to the use of domain models to represent semantic information. These models created by domain committees for prescriptions, lab results, patient summaries, etc. do not require a sections' outline specification for computer interoperability and therefore do not include it. The lack of such specification prohibits the direct re-use of these models within the CDA standard.</mif:li>
                                 <mif:li>Intermingling semantic and rendering information results in the need for a profusion of document specifications. Even if there is a consensus on the appropriate "semantic" modeling for a particular structure, there can be variations in how that data is organized for human presentation. For example, should a document have a single section for all "health conditions", or should allergies and intolerances be split out into their own section? Should allergies and intolerances be split? How about drug vs. non-drug? Severe vs. moderate? Depending on the use-case, any of these degrees of presentation's granularity could be appropriate. At the document level, there could be different approaches the same document, e.g., a molecular biology testing report can have different outlines depending on whether you choose to use the geneticists, pathologists or molecular diagnostics recommendations (see http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Outline_comparison_table). However, the need to support various outlines might result in replicating the full semantic structure, re-organized according to the way the data is to be rendered. Similar differences might be made for documents intended for exploration on small-display or mobile devices vs. full-size computers. </mif:li>
                                 <mif:li>A given document can only be rendered in one manner. If you want to allow multiple renderings, you need to send multiple documents.</mif:li>
                              </mif:ul>
                           </mif:div>
                           <mif:div hl7Id="BenefitsoftheSplit" title="Benefits of the Split">
                              <mif:p>Splitting rendering and semantics allows for more robust representation of the structured data, e.g., through clinical statements that span entries rendered/referenced in multiple sections.  For example, an overall interpretation of testing results rendered in multiple sections requires a clinical statement that associates the interpretations of observations rendered in those different sections.</mif:p>
                              <mif:p>Most importantly, separating semantic and presentation structures allows easy re-use of clinical domain structures within CDA documents. A domain model produced by work groups such as Pharmacy, Lab or Clinical Genomics, can easily be leveraged for use in a clinical document by defining a simple structure of labeled sections and sub-sections with references to the portions of the clinical domain model appropriate to each section.</mif:p>
                              <mif:p>Splitting the model and the rendering information also allows division of labor and helps manage the "standardization" process. You can separate arguments about "what information is needed and how it is represented?" from arguments about "how is this data best rendered to clinicians".</mif:p>
                              <mif:p>Finally, by splitting the sections outline from the semantic data being expressed in those sections, there is a potential for a single document to be sent with multiple sets of "rendering" instructions, either for different devices or for different types of recipients (e.g., practitioners versus patients, pathologists versus geneticists, etc). However, this benefit is not yet realized in the technical approach described below.</mif:p>
                           </mif:div>
                           <mif:div hl7Id="theTechnicalApproach" title="The Technical Approach">
                              <mif:p>To achieve the split of semantics and rendering in CDA R3, it is possible to change the association of the clinical statement structure (represented in R3 by the A_CdaActStatement CMET) by hanging it off the Document class instead of the Section class. The following figure illustrates the change: the blue rectangle on the left hangs off the Document class and has the association to the CDA Act Statement structure, while the blue rectangle on the right hangs off the Section class and has the reference mechanism to allow XPath references from the section's narrative to the respective act statements.</mif:p>
                              <mif:p>Need to get the figure in here.</mif:p>
                              <mif:p>Alternative Modeling:</mif:p>
                              <mif:ol>
                                 <mif:li>References to entries -- Alternatively to the abovementioned reference class hanging off directly of the Section class, it is possible to use the existing CDA R2 narrative entries linkage mechanism that will be preserved in CDA R3. Such links could give higher precision to link specific pieces of the narrative content to the respective entries. 
</mif:li>
                                 <mif:li>Source class for the entries -- Alternatively to the abovementioned Act Statement hanging off the ClinicalDocument class, entries could hang off the StructuredBody class. This option has been under discussion and is open to comments as well.

                        <mif:p>The notion of CDA "levels" in CDA, Release One anticipated a hierarchical set of XML DTDs or XML Schemas to achieve the goals enumerated above (see Goals and Design Principles). This hierarchy formed an "architecture", hence the "A" in "CDA". </mif:p>
                        <mif:p>While the notion of levels in CDA, Release Two remains constant, the approach to representing the hierarchies has changed. The current specification consists of a single CDA XML Schema, and the architecture arises from the ability to apply one or more of a hierarchical set of HL7 Templates, which serve to constrain the richness and flexibility of CDA. </mif:p>
                        <mif:p>NOTE: The CDA can be constrained by mechanisms defined in HL7 V3 Refinement and Localization. HL7 technical formalisms (e.g. HL7 Template specifications, HL7 Model Interchange Format) to constrain CDA are still in development at the time of writing this standard. </mif:p>
                        <mif:p>The RIM's InfrastructureRoot class contains an attribute, templateId, which is available for use in CDA. Thus, while HL7 Templates are in flux at this time, CDA provides a mechanism to reference a template or implementation guide that has been assigned a unique identifier. Until there is a formal HL7 Template specification, there is no standardized process to test conformance against referenced templates. </mif:p>
                        <mif:p>There is no requirement that CDA must be constrained. Implementations that use structured data elements to drive automated processes will typically require that they be either: (1) constrained by an appropriately refined model or other HL7 approved constraint language; or (2) comply with a detailed implementation guide that details the manner in which structured elements are to be represented and their intended interpretation to a level sufficient to ensure a degree of clinical safety that is appropriate to the use case that it is designed to address. </mif:p>
                        <mif:p>There are many kinds of HL7 Templates that might be created. Among them, two are particularly relevant for clinical documents: (1) those that constrain the document sections based on the type of document (section-level templates); (2) those that constrain the entries within document sections (entry-level templates). In fact, a comparison can be made between the prior notion of CDA levels and the current notion of CDA with these two kinds of HL7 Templates: </mif:p>

                     <mif:div hl7Id="HumanReadability" title="Human Readability and Rendering CDA Documents">
                        <mif:p>The CDA requirement for human readability guarantees that a receiver of a CDA document can algorithmically display the clinical content of the note on a standard Web browser. CDA, Release Two, with its blend of narrative and CDA entries, presents new challenges to this requirement. </mif:p>
                        <mif:p>Among the requirements affecting the design of CDA Release 3 are the following:</mif:p>
                        <mif:ul>
                           <mif:li>There must be a deterministic way for a recipient of an arbitrary CDA document to render the attested content.</mif:li>
                           <mif:li>Human readability SHALL NOT require a sender to transmit a special style sheet along with a CDA document. It must be possible to render all CDA documents with a single style sheet and general-market display tools.</mif:li>
                           <mif:li>Human readability applies to the authenticated content. There may be additional information conveyed in the document that is there primarily for machine processing that is not authenticated and need not be rendered. </mif:li>
                           <mif:li>When structured content is derived from narrative, there must be a mechanism to describe the process (e.g. by author, by human coder, by natural language processing algorithm, by specific software) by which machine-processable portions were derived from a block of narrative. </mif:li>
                           <mif:li>When narrative is derived from structured content, there must be a mechanism to identify the process by which narrative was generated from structured data. </mif:li>
                        </mif:ul>
                        <mif:p>These principles and requirements have led to the current approach, where the material to be rendered is placed into the Section.text field (see Section Narrative Block). The content model of this field is specially hand crafted to meet the above requirements, and corresponds closely to the content model of sections in CDA, Release One. Structured observations can reference narrative content in the Section.text field. Multimedia observations are encoded outside the Section.text field, and the &lt;renderMultiMedia&gt; tag within the Section.text field provides an outgoing pointer that indicates where the referenced multimedia should be rendered. </mif:p>
                     </mif:div>
                     <mif:div hl7Id="XMLMarkup" title="XML Markup of CDA Documents">
                        <mif:p>This section will be significantly rewritten.</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>XML markup of CDA documents is prescribed in this specification. A valid CDA instance must validate against the CDA Schema after all extensions have been removed from it and may be subject to additional validation (see CDA Conformance (? 1.3 )). There is no prohibition against the use of multiple schema languages (e.g., W3C, DTD, RELAXNG) to perform validation, as so long as conforming instances are compatibleequivalent. </mif:p>
                        <mif:p>Design Principles of the CDA Schema include:</mif:p>
                        <mif:ul>
                           <mif:li>General Requirements: The design of the CDA Schema follows the more general requirements for CDA (see Goals and Design Principles (? 1.1.3 )). </mif:li>
                           <mif:li>CDA Schema and V3 Implementation Technology Specification (ITS) : The CDA Schema will follow the general V3 XML ITS. </mif:li>
                           <mif:li>RIM Mapping: The CDA Schema describes the style of XML markup of CDA instances for the purpose of exchange. It is derived using the HL7 methodology from the HL7 Reference Information Model.  The CDA XML Schema is useful for implementation purposes, but it should not be considered a replacement for comprehension of the RIM artifacts upon which it is built. It cannot be understood outside the context of this defining specification. At the same time, the CDA Schema is useful on its own for implementation purposes even though it is not intended to replicate or take the place of the R-MIM and HD. The CDA Schema, then, is not, in and of itself, an adequate map between conforming instance and the HL7 RIM. Semantic interoperability of CDA instances requires use and knowledge of the CDA Schema, R-MIM and HD as well as the corresponding RIM.</mif:li>
                           <mif:li>Document Analysis: The CDA Schema and conformant instances should adhere to the structure of documents in derivation of content models, as determined through document analysis.  The general content structure of CDA, with sections that can be nested, titles, paragraphs, tables, lists and media follows the general patterns used in clinical documentation.adhere to the requirements of document analysis in derivation of the content model.

				</mif:li>
                           <mif:li>Forward and Backward Compatibility: The CDA Schema should adhere to the requirements for forward and backward compatibility. (See Backwards and Forwards Compatibility (? 1.5 )) </mif:li>
                           <mif:li>Naming: While XML markup, by definition, is for machine processing, it should be optimized for human review, debug, and design. The CDA Schema is not "self-documenting", but meaning should be clear from tag name and documentation (e.g., mapping to RIM). The human-language sense of a tag name should not be counterintuitive. </mif:li>
                           <mif:li>Vocabulary: Vocabulary can be enumerated within the CDA Schema or in an external, referenced source. It is preferable to enumerate it when the vocabulary terms are both limited (not too large in number) and stable (not subject to change between ballot cycles). Where vocabulary is either too large or is subject to change, it is preferable to maintain it external to the CDA Schema and incorporate it by reference. In these cases, XML schema validation will not suffice for conformance. </mif:li>
                        </mif:ul>

                        <mif:p>Application systems sending and receiving CDA documents are responsible for meeting all legal requirements for document authentication, confidentiality, and retention. For communications over public media, cryptographic techniques for source/recipient authentication and secure transport of encapsulated documents may be required, and should be addressed with commercially available tools outside the scope of this standard. </mif:p>
                        <mif:p>The CDA does provide confidentiality status information to aid application systems in managing access to sensitive data. Confidentiality status may apply to the entire document or to specified segments of the document. </mif:p>

                        <mif:p>A CDA document is a defined and complete information object that can exist outside of a messaging context and/or can be a payload within an HL7 message (see CDA Document Exchange in HL7 Messages (? 3 )). Thus, the CDA complements HL7 messaging specifications. </mif:p>
                        <mif:p>Clinical documents can be revised, and they can be appended to existing documents. Ideally, an updated document would declare itself as obsolete, and would contain an explicit pointer to a more recent version. This would lessen the chances of a healthcare provider basing treatment decisions on erroneous or incomplete data. </mif:p>
                        <mif:p>In practice, however, it is impossible to guarantee an explicit forward pointer from an outdated version to the newer version. Without a process that tracks the chain of custody of clinical documents and all of their copies, there can be no way to guarantee that a clinical document being viewed has not been subsequently revised. </mif:p>

                     <mif:p>A conformant CDA document is one that at a minimum validates against the CDA Schema after all extensions have been removed, and that restricts its use of coded vocabulary to values allowable within the specified vocabulary domains. However a computer cannot validate every aspect of conformance. The focus of this section is to highlight these aspects of CDA that cannot be machine validated - particularly those aspects related to the CDA human readability requirements. </mif:p>

                     <mif:p>Because CDA is an exchange standard and may not represent the original form of a document, there are no persistent storage requirements for CDA documents defined in this standard. However, as noted above (see Relationship of the CDA to HL7 Messaging Standards (? 1.2.6 )), document management is critically interdependent with the CDA specification. The custodian identified in the CDA header (see custodian (? 4.2.2.3 )) is the participant charged with maintaining the original document, which may be in some form other than CDA. </mif:p>

CDA documents can be created via transformation from some other format, as a direct output of an authoring application, etc. The document originator often is responsible for communicating with a persistent storage location, often using HL7 V2 MDM or HL7 V3 Medical Records messages .

                                 <mif:li>If the CDA Body is structured, the label of a section must be conveyed in the Section.title component. The absence of the Section.title component signifies an unlabeled section.</mif:li>

Attested multimedia referenced in the narrative must be added as ObservationMedia and/or RegionOfInterest CDA entries.</mif:li>

                        <mif:p>In the most general forms of CDA exchange, an originator need not apply a templateId for every template that an object in an instance document conforms to. The implementation guide (IG) shall assert whenever templateIds are required for conformance.</mif:p>

Where CDA defines default values, the recipient must assume these values in the event that no value is contained in a CDA instance.The CDA Schema defines default values for many of the XML attributes that can appear in a CDA instance.  Receivers must behave as if these values had been supplied in an instance when no value is provided.  This can be readily accomplished by processing the instance using a Validating XML Parser and the supplied CDA Schema.  Other methods of applying this rule are also permitted.

                           <mif:li>Parse and interpret the complete CDA header : A recipient of a CDA document must be able to parse and interpret the complete CDA header. Because applications may choose to display demographic and other CDA header data drawn from a central master directory, the rendering of the CDA document header is at the discretion of the recipient. In addition, rendering of the CDA document header can be dependent on local business practice and context of use (e.g. electronic health record, de-identified scenario). Where a document originator wants to suggest a rendering, they can include one or more XML style sheets with an exchanged CDA document. Use of these style sheets is at the discretion of the recipient. </mif:li>

<mif:ol>
                                 <mif:li>o	If the CDA Document has a title, it must be rendered.</mif:li>

                     <mif:p>Locally-defined markup may be used when local semantics have no corresponding representation in the CDA specification. CDA seeks to standardize the highest level of shared meaning while providing a clean and standard mechanism for tagging meaning that is not shared. In order to support local extensibility requirements, it is permitted to include additional XML elements and attributes that are not included in the CDA schema. These extensions should not change the meaning of any of the standard data items, and receivers must be able to safely ignore these elements. Document recipients must be able to faithfully render the CDA document while ignoring extensions. </mif:p>
                     <mif:p>Extensions may be included in the instance in a namespace other than the HL7v3 namespace, but must not be included within an element of type ED (e.g., &lt;text&gt; within &lt;procedure&gt;) since the contents of an ED datatype within the conformant document may be in a different namespace. Since all conformant content (outside of elements of type ED) is in the HL7 namespace, the sender can put any extension content into a foreign namespace (any namespace other than the HL7 namespace). Receiving systems must not report an error if such extensions are present. </mif:p>
                     <mif:p>When these extension mechanisms mark up content of general relevance, HL7 encourages users to get their requirements formalized in a subsequent version of the standard so as to maximize the use of shared semantics. </mif:p>

                     <mif:p>NOTE: A detailed list of all changes between CDA, Release One and CDA, Release Two can be found in the appendix (see Changes from CDA Release 1 (? B.4 )). </mif:p>
                     <mif:p>The basic model of CDA, Release Two is essentially unchanged. A CDA document has a header and a body. The body contains nested sections. These sections can be coded using standard vocabularies, and can contain CDA entries. The main evolutionary steps in CDA, Release Two are that both header and body are fully RIM-derived, and there is a much richer assortment of entries to use within CDA sections. CDA, Release Two enables clinical content to be formally expressed to the extent that it is modeled in the RIM. </mif:p>
                     <mif:p>This section describes the types of changes that can be introduced to a new release of CDA and CDA principles of forward and backward compatibility. In general, changes can include the addition of new components; a renaming of components (including XML element and attribute names in the CDA Schema); a deprecation of components defined in a prior release; a change in cardinality of a component (either to tighten or to loosen); or a change in a vocabulary domain of a component (to add or change values, to change between CWE and CNE). The following set of guiding principles defines how CDA can continue to evolve, while protecting the investment implementers have made through their adoption of earlier releases. </mif:p>
                     <mif:ol>
                        <mif:li>Documentation : A new release of CDA will enumerate all substantive changes from the previous release. </mif:li>
                        <mif:li>Attested content: Attested, human readable content must be completely loss-less across CDA releases. Backwards and forwards compatibility on the attested content will be supported such that it will be possible for an automated transformation script to translate the human readable content in both directions.</mif:li>
                        <mif:li>New components : A new release of CDA can introduce new components. To preserve roundtrip translation capability, a translation from the new release to a prior release must represent the new components as extensions (e.g. local markup or local namespace). </mif:li>
                        <mif:li>Renaming : A new release of CDA can rename components (including XML element and attribute names). Where this occurs, a mapping table will list all changes. Renaming will adhere to the naming convention articulated above (see XML Markup of CDA Documents (? 1.2.4 )). </mif:li>
                        <mif:li>Deprecated components : A new release of CDA can deprecate components defined in a prior release. Deprecated components will be removed from the subsequent release of the standard, and therefore their use is not recommended. </mif:li>
                        <mif:li>Cardinality : A new release of CDA can change the cardinality of a component. Where an optional component becomes required, a translation between releases requires a dummy value or a null value. </mif:li>
                        <mif:li>Changes to vocabulary domain : A new release of CDA can change the vocabulary domain of a component. Where this occurs, a mapping table will list changes. </mif:li>
                        <mif:li>Change within CNE : Where a value in a CNE domain in a prior release is no longer present or has been renamed, a mapping table will indicate what the current value should be. </mif:li>
                        <mif:li>Change within CWE : When a CWE domain is expanded, users should begin using the new codes in addition to any equivalent local codes they may already be using. </mif:li>
                        <mif:li>Change from CWE to CNE : To preserve roundtrip translation capability, a translation between releases must represent unrecognized components as extensions (e.g. local markup or local namespace). Ideally these situations will surface during a ballot cycle, allowing the CNE domain to be sufficiently inclusive. </mif:li>
                     </mif:ol>
                     <mif:p>These guiding principles have lead to the current approach, defined in this Release Two of the CDA standard. The goal is to ensure that the documents created using Release One can be transformed into minimally compliant Release Two instances and that Release Two documents received can be down-translated to Release One instances using automated means (transformations) with no loss of attested, human-readable content and known limitation on loss of universal processing semantics. </mif:p>

                     <mif:p>A complete understanding of CDA requires an understanding of the normative artifacts used to define the specification. The CDA Hierarchical Description is the definitive source for CDA conformance rules, and serves as the source from which the CDA Schema is derived. While a CDA instance must validate against the CDA Schema, it must also adhere to the conformance rules stated in the CDA Hierarchical Description. The CDA Hierarchical Description is derived from the CDA R-MIM, which in turn is derived from the HL7 Reference Information Model (RIM). The HL7 RIM is the definitive source for class and attribute definitions. </mif:p>
                     <mif:p>The following sections summarize the artifacts used by CDA, and how they can be used by those seeking to implement or understand the CDA specification. </mif:p>

                     <mif:p>The HL7 RIM is the definitive reference source for class and attribute definitions. The CDA specification does not exhaustively replicate RIM definitions, but instead refers the reader to the RIM for complete definitions. While CDA may further constrain RIM definitions, at no time will CDA definitions conflict with those in the RIM. </mif:p>
                     <mif:p>	

CDA, Release Three is derived from HL7 RIM, Version 2.xx. </mif:p>
                     <mif:p>Where a reader needs to see the complete definition of a RIM attribute or class, they should refer to the HL7 RIM. </mif:p>

                     <mif:p>HL7 defines both an abstract data type specification, which is the definitive reference, and an XML-specific data type representation. </mif:p>
                     <mif:p>Data types define the structural format of the data carried within a RIM attribute and influence the set of allowable values an attribute may assume. Some data types have very little intrinsic semantic content. However HL7 also defines more extensive data types such as the one for an entity's name. Every attribute in the RIM is associated with one and only one data type. </mif:p>
                     <mif:p>CDA, Release Three uses the HL7 V3 Data Types, Release Two abstract and XML-specific specification. </mif:p>
                     <mif:p>A reader will often find that the XML-specific description of a data type is sufficient for implementation, but at times will want to refer to the abstract data type specification for a more comprehensive discussion. </mif:p>

                  <mif:div hl7Id="HL7Vocabulary" title="HL7 Vocabulary Domains">
                     <mif:p>The definitive description of HL7 V3 Vocabulary Domains can be found here. </mif:p>
                     <mif:p>Vocabulary domains represent value sets for coded CDA components. These domains can include HL7-defined concepts or can be drawn from HL7-recognized coding systems such as LOINC or SNOMED. The HL7 Vocabulary chapter is the definitive reference source for the definitions of HL7-defined concepts. While CDA may further constrain these definitions, at no time will CDA definitions conflict with those in the Vocabulary chapter. </mif:p>
                     <mif:p>Vocabulary domains have a coding strength that can be "Coded, No Extensions" (CNE), in which case the only allowable values for the CDA component are those in stated value set; or "Coded, With Extensions" (CWE), in which case values outside the stated value set can be used if necessary. Every vocabulary domain has a unique HL7-assigned identifier, and every concept within a vocabulary domain has a unique code. </mif:p>
                     <mif:p>Where a coded CDA component is associated with a CNE value set, the allowable values are fixed by the standard, and are enumerated as shown in the following example: </mif:p>

                     <mif:p>A number of vocabulary domains and coding systems already in existence (e.g., LOINC, SNOMED) may be used to encode concepts in CDA documents (e.g., Section.code, Observation.code). These domains are referenced as external domains according to HL7 V3 processes. Where a coded CDA component is associated with a CWE vocabulary domain, a preferred value set may be specified by the standard (such as for ClinicalDocument.code or for ClinicalDocument.confidentialityCode). Where the standard does not enumerate any values, the implementor is free to choose from any external source, such as LOINC or SNOMED or some other realm-specific vocabulary. </mif:p>

                     <mif:p>The definitive description of the HL7 V3 model refinement process, R-MIM development and interpretation can be found here. </mif:p>
                     <mif:p>The CDA R-MIM is described below (see CDA R-MIM (? 4 )). </mif:p>
                     <mif:p>HL7 specifications derived from the HL7 RIM use a process known as "cloning" to refine domain specific models from the base HL7 RIM. When a refined model makes use of a specialization of an HL7 RIM class, the new class in the refined model is known as a clone of the HL7 RIM class. These specializations may further constrain the base class, for example, by specifying more restrictive attribute cardinality or by further constraints on the allowed vocabulary values. Multiple clones of a particular HL7 RIM class may appear in a refined model, each representing a different specialization. </mif:p>
                     <mif:p>The CDA R-MIM is a graphical representation of the CDA specification. It is presented using diagramming conventions and notations that were developed by HL7 to represent the specific semantic constructs contained in the critical, "back-bone" classes of the RIM. Although it could be represented in UML notation, as the RIM is, the HL7 notation provides more details about the specific constraints and class clones being represented. The HL7 diagramming convention abbreviates some relationship conventions, enabling diagrams to be smaller and more concise and to convey more information visually. </mif:p>
                     <mif:p>The CDA R-MIM is a graphical aid to understanding the specification. Because the CDA Hierarchical Description, and subsequently the CDA Schema, are derived from the R-MIM, the R-MIM serves as a good basis for describing the standard. The narrative description of the specific clones used by CDA is organized to correspond with the R-MIM. </mif:p>

                     <mif:p>The CDA HD is described below (see CDA Hierarchical Description (? 5 )). </mif:p>
                     <mif:p>A Hierarchical Description is a tabular representation of the sequence of elements (i.e., classes, attributes and associations) represented in an R-MIM and that define the structure of the instance without reference to XML or any other implementation technology. </mif:p>
                     <mif:p>The CDA HD is the definitive source for CDA conformance rules, and serves as the source from which the CDA Schema is derived. While a CDA instance must validate against the CDA Schema, it must also adhere to the conformance rules stated in the CDA Hierarchical Description. For CDA, Release Two, the CDA HD is uniquely identified by the string "POCD_HD000040". As described below (see Clinical Document (? 4.1 )), this value must be included in a CDA instance to serve as an unambiguous reference to the CDA, Release Two specification. </mif:p>

                     <mif:p>The CDA Schema is described below (see CDA XML Implementation (? 6 )). </mif:p>

                  <mif:p>NOTE: The exact method by which a CDA instance is packaged and exchanged is outside the scope of this standard. While the MIME packaging method described here is not normative, it does illustrate one mechanism that meets the document exchange requirements described below. </mif:p>
                  <mif:p>Any CDA exchange strategy must accommodate the following requirements: </mif:p>
                  <mif:ul>
                     <mif:li>All components of a CDA document that are integral to its state of wholeness (such as attested multimedia) are able to be included in a single exchange package.</mif:li>
                     <mif:li>Content needing to be rendered if exchanging across a firewall where the links won't be traversable, must be able to be included in a single exchange package. </mif:li>
                     <mif:li>Additional files associated with a CDA document to provide the recipient with the sender's rendering suggestions (such as one or more style sheets) are able to be included in a single exchange package. </mif:li>
                     <mif:li>There is no need to change any of the references (e.g., a reference to attested multimedia in a separate file) within the base CDA document when creating the exchange package. </mif:li>
                     <mif:li>There is no need to change any of the references (e.g., a reference to attested multimedia in a separate file) within the base CDA document when extracting the contents of an exchange package. </mif:li>
                     <mif:li>There is no need to change any values of attributes of type XML ID when creating the exchange package.</mif:li>
                     <mif:li>There are no restrictions on the directory structure used by receivers. Receivers can place the components of the CDA document into directories of their choosing. </mif:li>
                     <mif:li>Critical metadata about the CDA instance needed for document management (e.g. document state, document archival status) must be included in the exchange package. (For a complete discussion of clinical document metadata, document management, and HL7 V3 document states and state transitions, refer to the HL7 V3 Medical Records specification). </mif:li>
                  </mif:ul>
                  <mif:p>From the perspective of a V2.x or V3 message, a CDA document can be thought of as a multimedia object that can be exchanged as a Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME, RFC 2046) package, encoded as an encapsulated data type (ED). </mif:p>
                  <mif:p>The current MIME recommendation is to follow the approach described in the Internet standard RFC 2557 "MIME Encapsulation of Aggregate Documents, such as HTML (MHTML)", which is the approach for the MIME encapsulations of aggregate documents used by ebXML and DICOM. </mif:p>
                  <mif:p>In V2.x, CDA documents are to be exchanged in the OBX segment, in any message that can exchange documents (such as MDM). Within the OBX segment, the MIME package is placed in OBX.5 (Field 00573 Observation value), encoded as a V2.x encapsulated data type. The value of OBX.2 (Field 00570 Value Type) should be set to "ED". The value of OBX.3 should be the same as ClinicalDocument.code. </mif:p>
                  <mif:p>Many fields in the message will overlap in meaning with fields in the CDA document. The following table shows the correspondence between the HL7 V2 MDM message's TXA segment and components of CDA. </mif:p>

                              <mif:p>The participant2 association from the ClinicalDocument class to the R_Participant CDA CMET represents a new feature for CDA R3. The inclusion of this association, along with the R_Participant CMET represent a standard, RIM semantic based extension space for the CDA R3 header. For CDA R2, when an implementer discovered a requirement for additional header elements that could not be cleanly represented in the CDA R2 header, they were faced with the option of either pushing the information into the CDA Entries, adding an extension in a separate XML namespace, or miss-using an existing header element. None of these options are particularly palatable, particularly the last. As a step towards avoiding the problem how to represent header extensions entirely, the participant2 association along with the R_Participant CMET have been added to the CDA R3 Header. </mif:p>
                              <mif:p>The participant2 participation class includes all the RIM attributes from the participation class. All participation type codes are allowed in this participation.

                                 <mif:p>Since participant2 and R_Participant represent a CDA header extension space, use of the extensions is completely dependent on implementation agreement. This header extension space is an exception to the general rule that CDA implementers must be able to parse and understand the entire CDA header. At most, implementers are expected to support only specific templates (defined in the course of implementations) that utilize elements from participant2 and R_Participant.</mif:p>
                                 <mif:p>Templates using participant2 and R_Participant SHALL adhere to the following conformance statements:</mif:p>

                                    <mif:li>ClinicalDocument.participant2.templateId SHALL be valued (CONF 1) -- Use of participant2 association can only be done via a defined template. The avoids undefined use of the header extension space.

                                    <mif:li>ClinicalDocument.participatn2.typeCode SHALL NOT equal PART (CONF 2) -- Use of the PART participation type is not allowed. Template developers shall use a more specific participation type code for the header extension represented by the template. The PART participation type code is a root code for all participation type code and needs to be specialized to convey the specific semantics of the participation
</mif:li>
                                    <mif:li>Templates based on participant2 and R_Participant SHALL be closed templates. (CONF 3) --Note that a closed template is one that does not allow additional content beyond what is specifically defined in the template, in other words, those elements not expressly allowed (via a SHALL, SHOULD, MAY) in a template are forbidden. This conformance statement is intended to prevent undefined use of the extension space except by clearly defined templates.
</mif:li>
                                    <mif:li>Note Regarding Open And Closed Templates: In open templates, all of the features of the CDA R3 base specification are allowed except as constrained by the templates. By contrast, a closed template specifies everything that is allowed and nothing further may be included. Open templates allow HL7 implementers to develop additional structured content not constrained in the template. HL7 encourages implementers to bring their use cases forward as candidate requirements to be formalized in a subsequent version of the standard to maximize the use of shared semantics.

                                 <mif:p>Where the semantics of a particular template can be correctly captured using the existing CDA R3 participations (authenticator [AUTHEN], legalAuthenticator [LA], informationRecipient [x_informationRecipient], author [AUT], custodian [CST], dataEnterer [ENT], subject [SBJ], recordTarget [RCT], informant [INF] and participant1 [all participation type codes]) those participations should be used. Template developers using participant2 may use participant2.typeCode values that also appear in the other CDA header participations as noted above. Developers should be aware that CDA R3 uses the vocabulary based context conduction. This means that adding a participant2 participation that uses the same typeCode as one of the other ClinicalDocument participations adds to the ClinicalDocument context as opposed to over-riding the equivalent participation. For instance, if the participant2.typeCode is assigned the RCT typeCode in a template, this means the CDA Document ends up with two RCT (record target) participations. Template developers will want to consider including restrictions on the use of equivalent participations in the header as part of the extension template if the intent of the extension is to over-ride other participations as opposed to adding to the context.</mif:p>
                                 <mif:p>It is strongly encouraged that developers of templates based on the CDA R3 header extension space register those templates in a public template registry.</mif:p>

                              <mif:p>A clinical document can be replaced by a new document and/or appended with an addendum.</mif:p>
                              <mif:p>A replacement document is a new version of the parent document. The parent document is considered superseded, but a system may retain it for historical or auditing purposes. The parent document being replaced is referenced via act relationship relatedDocument, where relatedDocument.typeCode is set to equal "RPLC" (for "replaces"). An example is a report found to contain an error that is subsequently replaced by the corrected report.</mif:p>
                              <mif:p>An addendum is a separate document that references the parent document, and may extend or alter the observations in the prior document. The parent document remains a current component of the patient record, and the addendum and its parent are both read by report recipients. The parent report (represented by the ParentDocument class) being appended is referenced via act relationship relatedDocument, where relatedDocument.typeCode is set to equal "APND" (for "appends").</mif:p>
                              <mif:p>Every CDA document must have a unique ClinicalDocument.id, and thus the replacement or addendum documents each have ClinicalDocument.id that is different from that of the parent document.</mif:p>
                              <mif:p>CDA documents may also contain a ClinicalDocument.setId and a ClinicalDocument.versionNumber, which together support a document identification and versioning scheme used in some document management systems. In this scheme, all documents in a chain of replacements have the same ClinicalDocument.setId and are distinguished by an incrementing ClinicalDocument.versionNumber. The initial version of a document gets, in addition to a new unique value for ClinicalDocument.id, a new value for ClinicalDocument.setId, and has the value of ClinicalDocument.versionNumber set to equal "1". A replacement document gets a new globally unique ClinicalDocument.id value, and uses the same value for ClinicalDocument.setId as the parent report being replaced, and increments the value of ClinicalDocument.versionNumber by 1. (Note that version number must be incremented by one when a report is replaced, but can also be incremented more often to meet local requirements.)</mif:p>
                              <mif:p>These relationships are illustrated in the following exhibit "Document Identification, Revisions, and Addenda Scenarios". Typical scenarios are a simple relacement (e.g. ClinicalDocument.id "1.2.345.6789.266" replacing ClinicalDocument.id "1.2.345.6789.123") and a simple append (e.g. ClinicalDocument.id "1.2.345.6789.456" appends ClinicalDocument.id "1.2.345.6789.123"). More complex scenarios that might be anticipated include: [1] replacement of an addendum (e.g. ClinicalDocument.id "1.2.345.6789.224" replaces ClinicalDocument.id "1.2.345.6789.456", which itself is an addendum to ClinicalDocument.id "1.2.345.6789.123") - expected behavior would be to render the replacement as the addendum (e.g. render ClinicalDocument.id "1.2.345.6789.224" as the addendum to ClinicalDocument.id "1.2.345.6789.123"); [2] addendum to a replaced document (e.g. ClinicalDocument.id "1.2.345.6789.456" appends ClinicalDocument.id "1.2.345.6789.123", which has been replaced by ClinicalDocument.id "1.2.345.6789.266") - expected behavior would be to render the addendum along with the replacement (e.g. render ClinicalDocument.id "1.2.345.6789.456" as an addendum to ClinicalDocument.id "1.2.345.6789.266").</mif:p>

                              </mif:p>
                              <mif:p>A CDA document can be a transformation from some other format, meaning that it has undergone a machine translation from some other format (such as DICOM SR). In this case, relatedDocument.typeCode should be set to "XFRM".</mif:p>
                              <mif:p>A proper transformation must ensure that the human readable clinical content of the report is not impacted. Local business rules determine whether or not a transformed report replaces the source, but typically this would not be the case. If it is, an additional relationship of type "RPLC" is to be used. The "XFRM" relationship can also be used when translating a document in a local format into CDA for the purpose of exchange. In this case, the target of the "XFRM" relationship is the local document identifier.</mif:p>
                              <mif:p>There will be a figure here.</mif:p>

                              <mif:p>In some cases, the ServiceEvent is inherent in the ClinicalDocument.code, such as where ClinicalDocument.code is "History and Physical Report" and the procedure being documented is a "History and Physical" act. A ServiceEvent can further specialize the act inherent in the ClinicalDocument.code, such as where the ClinicalDocument.code is simply "Procedure Report" and the procedure was a "colonoscopy". If ServiceEvent is included, it must be equivalent to or further specialize the value inherent in the ClinicalDocument.code, and shall not conflict with the value inherent in the ClinicalDocument.code, as such a conflict would constitute an ambiguous situation.</mif:p>

The narrative schema defined for CDA R3 has been aligned with a subset of the elements found in HTML, in order to simplify content generation and presentation. One notable exception is the continued reliance on &lt;footnote&gt; and &lt;footnoteRef&gt;, which are typically not included in clinical notes, but were retained for backwards comparability and continued support of SPL.  </mif:p>

                              <mif:p>The content model of the CDA Narrative Block schema is specially hand crafted to meet the requirements outlined above (see Human Readability and Rendering CDA Documents (? 1.2.3 )). The schema will be registered as a MIME type (text/x-hl7-text+xml-r2), which is the fixed media type for Section.text. Components of the schema are described in the sections that follow. </mif:p>

                                 <mif:p>The CDA &lt;span&gt; element is used to wrap a string of text so that it can be explicitly referenced, or so that it can suggest rendering characteristics. The &lt;span&gt; element can nest recursively, which enables wrapping a string of plain text down to as small a chunk as desired. </mif:p>
                                 <mif:p>The &lt;span&gt; element contains an optional identifier, that can serve as the target of a reference. All values of attributes of type XML ID must be unique within the document (per the W3C XML specification). The originalText component of a RIM attribute present in any CDA entry can make explicit reference to the identifier, thereby indicating the original text associated with the attribute in the CDA entry. </mif:p>

                                 <mif:p>The CDA &lt;a&gt; is a generic referencing mechanism, similar to the HTML anchor tag. It can be used to reference identifiers that are either internal or external to the document. </mif:p>
                                 <mif:p>Multimedia that is integral to a document, and part of the attestable content of the document requires the use of a supporting reference to an ObservationMedia CDA entry, which is referenced by the &lt;img&gt; narrative element (see &lt;img&gt; (? 4.3.5.7 )). </mif:p>
                                 <mif:p>Multimedia that is simply referenced by the document and not an integral part of the attested document can use the &lt;img&gt; element without a corresponding reference to an ObservationMedia or RegionOfInterest CDA entry. </mif:p>
                                 <mif:p>The source of a link uses the a.href attribute. The target of an internal reference is an identifier of type XML ID, which can exist on other elements in the same or a different narrative block, or XML ID attribute of type xs:ID  that have been added to the &lt;section&gt;, &lt;ObservationMedia&gt;, or any narrative element of the CDA Narrative Schema providing an attribute of type xs:ID. The use of the a.name attribute is deprecated, because attributes of type XML ID provide an alternative and more consistent target for referencing. Following the conventions of HTML, an internal link is prefaced with the pound sign, as shown in the following example. </mif:p>

The usage of the elements is limited to a single generation, in that it only reflects the changes from the preceding version of a document. If applied, it needs to be used in conjunction with standard CDA revision tracking. Changes to a CDA document that has been released for patient care still require a formal versioning and revision, and the revised document can optionally carry the &lt;ins&gt; and / or &lt;del&gt; elements to show the delta in the narrative.

                           <mif:p>CDA context is set in the CDA header and applies to the entire document. Context can be overridden at the level of the body, section, and/or CDA entry.</mif:p>

                              <mif:p>A document, in a sense, is a contextual wrapper for its contents. Assertions in the document header are typically applicable to statements made in the body of the document, unless overridden. For instance, the patient identified in the header is assumed to be the subject of observations described in the body of the document, unless a different subject is explicitly stated, or the author identified in the header is assumed to be the author of the entire document, unless a different author is explicitly identified on a section. The objective of the CDA context rules is to make these practices explicit with relationship to the RIM, such that a computer will understand the context of a portion of a document the same way that a human interprets it.</mif:p>
                              <mif:p>At the same time, there is no guarantee that machine processing will identify a mistaken application of contextual rules. If a physician records an "outside diagnosis" in narrative but does not nullify the "informant" context, machine processing will not identify the switch in attribution. This is a special case illustrating the limits of automated validation of electronic records and would apply regardless of the context inheritance mechanism. In other words, from some errors of encoding, there is no recovery other than human review.</mif:p>
                              <mif:p>CDA's approach to context, and the propagation of that context to nested document components, follows these design principles: 	 </mif:p>

                                 <mif:li>The CDA Header sets context for the entire document. A propagating value specified in the document header holds true throughout the document, unless explicitly overridden.

                                 <mif:li>In principle, context propagates from outer tags to nested tags. Context that is specified on an outer tag holds true for all nested tags, unless overridden on a nested tag. Context specified on a tag within the CDA body always overrides context propagated from an outer tag. For instance, the specification of authorship at a document section level overrides all authorship propagated from outer tags.</mif:li>
                                 <mif:li>Context is sometimes known precisely, and is sometimes unknown, such as in the case where a document is comprised of a large unparsed narrative block that potentially includes statements that contradict outer context. Because CDA context always propagates unless overridden, the representation of unknown context is achieved by overriding with a null value.</mif:li>

                                 <mif:li>The root class of CDA is the ClinicalDocument Act. The new Core Principles of HL7 v3 describe context as follows: "the context of particular Act is defined as the set of ActRelationship and Participation relationships that are properties of that Act, whether they stem directly from the Act in question or were conducted to it across an ActRelationship leading into the class."</mif:li>
                                 <mif:li>CDA R3 uses the new RIM context mechanism and defaults the context conduction to be vocabulary-based (as specified in model entry point: "Property-contextConductionStyle: V").</mif:li>
                                 <mif:li>CDA R3 uses the value of the "conductible" property of the code asserted for the given element's typeCode (i.e., the typeCode of ActRelationship or Participation); the attributes blockedContextActRelationshipType,  blockedContextParticipationType and actAttributeContextBlockedInd of ActRelationships), and constrain the RIM context model by assigning fixed values to these attributes in the header, to accomplish the design objectives below.</mif:li>

                     <mif:p>The CDA HD is the definitive source for CDA conformance rules, and serves as the source from which the CDA Schema is derived. While a CDA instance must validate against the CDA Schema, it must also adhere to the conformance rules stated in the CDA Hierarchical Description, and to the rules expressed in the narrative of this specification. </mif:p>
                     <mif:p>HL7 enables conformance specification at the level of each RIM attribute. RIM attributes can be defined as "Required", in which case the originator must populate the attribute where a value is known even if the cardinality is optional, and "Mandatory", in which case the originator must populate the attribute with a non-NULL value in all cases. </mif:p>
                     <mif:p>In CDA, Release Two, the "Required" and "Mandatory" conformance indicators are applied as follows: </mif:p>
                     <mif:ul>
                        <mif:li>Required attributes: <mif:ul>
                              <mif:li>Section.text</mif:li>
                              <mif:li>All attributes where lower cardinality is greater than 0.</mif:li>
                           </mif:ul>
                        </mif:li>
                        <mif:li>Mandatory Attributes:

                              <mif:li>ClinicalDocument.typeId</mif:li>

                              </mif:li>
                              <mif:li>Context attributes <mif:ul>
                                    <mif:li>contextControlCode</mif:li>

                              </mif:li>
                           </mif:ul>
                        </mif:li>
                     </mif:ul>
                     <mif:p>	

Note: Note that where Mandatory attributes have a default or fixed value supplied in the CDA HD, the instance need not contain a value. In such cases, the receiver must assume the default value. </mif:p>
